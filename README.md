# Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition
Handwritten Digit Recognition uses machine learning to identify digits (0–9) from images of handwritten text. Trained on datasets like MNIST, models such as neural networks classify digits with high accuracy, enabling applications in OCR, form processing, and digitized input systems.
Handwritten Digit Recognition Using Machine Learning

A machine learning project that recognizes handwritten digits (0–9) using image classification. This project uses the **MNIST dataset** and a **Neural Network model** (built using TensorFlow/Keras) to accurately predict handwritten digits from 28x28 pixel grayscale images.

Features

- Recognizes digits from 0 to 9
- Trained using a neural network on the MNIST dataset
- Achieves high accuracy on test data
- Visualizes training performance (loss & accuracy)
- Displays sample predictions
- Accepts user-drawn digits (optional feature with GUI)
- Saves and loads trained models
  Easily customizable architecture and parameters

Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (for development)
- Tkinter or OpenCV (for optional digit drawing GUI)

Dataset

- **MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology)**
- 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images
- Each image is a 28x28 grayscale pixel representation of a handwritten digit

Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/handwritten-digit-recognition.git
   cd handwritten-digit-recognition
Install dependencies

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the notebook

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook digit_recognition.ipynb

How It Works
The MNIST dataset is loaded and preprocessed (normalized and reshaped).
A neural network model is defined using Keras Sequential API.
The model is trained on the training data.
Accuracy is evaluated on the test set.
Sample predictions are visualized.

Sample Output
Model Accuracy: ~98%

Sample prediction visualization:

Input: Handwritten digit (28x28)

Output: Predicted label (e.g., "3")

Future Improvements
Add Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for better accuracy
Implement real-time digit input via mouse or touchscreen
Deploy as a web app using Flask or Streamlit
Mobile app integration
