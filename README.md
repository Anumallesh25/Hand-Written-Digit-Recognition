# Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition
Handwritten Digit Recognition uses machine learning to identify digits (0â€“9) from images of handwritten text. Trained on datasets like MNIST, models such as neural networks classify digits with high accuracy, enabling applications in OCR, form processing, and digitized input systems.
